It is actually so popular that it has also a GUI version, called Gvim, and vim-mode plugins for most of the other text editors out there, including Sublime, Atom and VS Code.</p><p>Vim always had tons of plugins available, for simple things like color schemes or a better status line (powerline, airline, lightline) to more complex like a tree file browser (nerdtree), fuzzy directory search (ctrlp) or git integration (fugitive), just to mention some. It wasn’t, on the other hand, much user-friendly to install plugins, that is why there were also plugins for installing plugins (pathogen, vundle, plug).</p><p>These plugins usually define a new directory for installed plugins (default was ~/.vim/plugin) and some scripts to fetch the plugin code from GitHub and place in this directory, mimicking the behavior of other editors package managers.</p><p>Until now…</p><h4>Vim 8 packages</h4><p>Version 8 introduced a new, very simple, <em>pack</em> system for installing plugins, created to help users manage all of their plugins in the same archive. Instead of creating a new way for downloading plugins as the afore-mentioned solutions do, it just defines a new plugin directory structure, and the user can decide how to fetch and update plugins.</p><p>From vim <em>:help packages</em></p><blockquote>A Vim package is a directory that contains one or more plugins. The <br>advantages over normal plugins: <br>- A package can be downloaded as an archive and unpacked in its own directory. <br> Thus the files are not mixed with files of other plugins. That makes it <br> easy to update and remove. <br>- A package can be a git, mercurial, etc. repository. That makes it really <br> easy to update. <br>- A package can contain multiple plugins that depend on each other. <br>- A package can contain plugins that are automatically loaded on startup and <br> ones that are only loaded when needed with `:packadd`.</blockquote><p>Any directory under <strong>~/.vim/pack</strong> is considered a package. A package can hold plugins in two different directories, <strong>start</strong> and <strong>opt</strong>. The plugins under <strong>start/</strong> folder are loaded on startup, while the plugins under <strong>opt/</strong> folder are loaded manually by the user with the command <strong>:packadd</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>~/.vim/pack/*/start/{name}<br></strong>Plugin auto loaded on startup</li><li><strong>~/.vim/pack/*/opt/{name}<br></strong>Plugin loaded manually, with<strong> :packadd {name}</strong></li></ul><p>When using Vim packages, you can unpack or <strong>git clone</strong> your desired packages directly into these directories. Or even use git submodules to keep them all in sync among several machines.</p><h4>Installing and organizing Vim packages</h4><p>The final directory structure under <strong>~/.vim/pack </strong>is up to your own organization, but here goes what I do…</p><p>I split my plugins into three different packages:</p><ul><li><strong>~/.vim/pack/plugins<br></strong>For general plugins or anything that doesn&#39;t fit on the other directories.</li><li><strong>~/.vim/pack/colors<br></strong>For color schemes</li><li><strong>~/.vim/pack/syntax<br></strong>For language syntax, compilers, linters, etc.</li></ul><p>Each of these directories can have two folders, start, and opt, with plugins on each one.</p><p>To install and keep them synced, I use git submodules (<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules</a>) and keep them saved in my dot-files repository (<a href="https://github.com/paulodiovani/dot-files">github.com/paulodiovani/dot-files</a>).</p><p>Here is an example of how to install packages under ~/.vim/pack using git submodules.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/5d9a79eb26af4869d533673dc4bae483/href">https://medium.com/media/5d9a79eb26af4869d533673dc4bae483/href</a></iframe><p>So, the new git package system is yet simple and even easier to maintain/update if you already use git to keep your configs synced.</p><p>My own setup is a bit more complex, since I have the submodules in an external repository (not under ~/.vim/pack) and use a Makefile to copy them to their final destination. But the result is the same. You can see the whole setup in my dot-files repository.</p><h4>Conclusion: Should I drop Pathogen/Vundle/Plug and start using the native packages?</h4><p>The short answer is <strong>No</strong>. These (and others) solutions for managing plugins will still work, and you should probably keep using if you’re comfortable with them.</p><p>The new Vim Packages are, however, a great option for starters, or who didn’t know the previous solutions, or even for who wants more flexibility while handling vim plugins.</p><p>Sources:<br>- <a href="https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#packages">https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#packages</a><br>- <a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it">https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it</a><br>- <a href="https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/">https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=39b71c351fea" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/codeminer-42/installing-vim-8-plugins-with-the-native-pack-system-39b71c351fea">Installing Vim(8) plugins with the native pack system</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/codeminer-42">The Miners</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
