<p>Here are some english podcasts I’ve been hearing for some time. They are good options to help to improve your listening skills if you are acquiring english as a second language, but also excellent shows for killing time.</p><p>In order of preference…</p><h4><a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour">TED Radio Hour</a></h4><p>This NPR podcast is a summary of some of the best TED Talks grouped by topic, with interviews with the speakers and extra content. The best part is that they are short programs (around 50 min) split into three or four talks which can be listened to separately.</p><p>TED Radio Hour is definitely my favorite english podcast and is always set to automatically download.</p><h4><a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a></h4><p>With two seasons so far, Serial podcast brings a crime and conviction (real) story revisited. It’s basically a series of interviews and reading/explanation of the case documents while telling the story from the beginning.</p><p>Also in auto-download whenever a new season goes online.</p><h4><a href="https://stownpodcast.org/">S-Town</a></h4><p>From the same producers of Serial and This American Life, in this single story, a reporter is asked to investigate the happenings of a small town.</p><h4><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510308/hidden-brain">Hidden Brain</a></h4><p>Another NPR podcast, this one about science and human behavior, with interesting topics about how our mind works.</p><h4><a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-talks/ted-talks-audio">TED Talks Daily</a></h4><p>Some TED talks are presented with videos, slideshows or images, but most of them can be appreciated with audio-only and TED itself provides them all in podcast format.</p><p>While TED Radio Hour brings a summary of topic grouped TED talks, this podcast includes their full content so it’s a good choice to listen more of what we liked most of the first one.</p><h4><a href="https://changelog.com/podcast">The Changelog</a></h4><p>I tried some technology podcasts but none of them really got my attention. The Changelog, however, is about open source and brings some news and curiosities in the area so it’s a good choice listening.</p><h4>Some Other options</h4><p>Some other that I don’t listen too often but still with good topics are This American Life, The Moth and Sincerely X.</p><p>Do you have anything yo say about the podcasts above? Do you have some recommendations worthy to tell? Please, leave in the comments section below. And good listening.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=436f817c76a" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/codeminer-42/some-english-podcasts-recommendations-436f817c76a">Some english podcasts recommendations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/codeminer-42">The Miners</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
