## Post Categories

All posts are published under three main categories. These are the main
topics I like to write about.

Whenever I feel to write about something else, it'll be an uncategorized
post.

### [Romance]

> **Romance** (from Vulgar Latin _rōmānicē_ "in the Roman language", i.e.
> "Latin") may refer to:
>
> [...]
>
> - medieval Romance literature, specifically the genre of the chivalric
> - romance literature

In Brazilian Portuguese, we have the following definition.

> O termo **romance** (do latim _romanice_: "em língua românica", através do
provençal _romans_) pode referir-se a dois gêneros literários. O primeiro deles
é uma composição poética popular, histórica ou lírica, transmitida pela
tradição oral, sendo geralmente de autor anônimo; corresponde aproximadamente
à balada medieval. Como forma literária moderna, o termo designa uma
composição em prosa.

In short, this category will present all posts related to literature or
derived from it, including novels, movies, TV shows and even video games.

### [Technology]

My late blogs were mostly about technology, usually about GNU/Linux or
software development.

This category includes these topics and also everything about innovations,
tendencies or jobs in the area.

### [Tabletop games]

Roleplaying games and boardgames are my first options in entertainment and I
like to discuss a lot about them. Specially when I'm reading about a new rules
system, testing a game, developing or making some hacks.

## English or Brazilian Portuguese

Portuguese is my native language and so, a lot of this blog content will
be written with it.

But a lot will be written in English too, mostly on the _Technology Category_,
as it's the most important (and necessary) language on the area.

I hope to be able to add <abbr title="internationalization">i18n</abbr> to this
blog and publish every content in both languages, but meanwhile, the post
language will be chosen according to the target public.
